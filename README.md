Abstract of the Project:
Four different solutions to the SLAM problem; namely RTABMap,
ORB SLAM3, LeGO-LOAM and an offline 3D graph slam were
implemented on the KITTI dataset, wherein ORB-SLAM3 performed
the best. The different issues and challenges faced were recorded and
satisfactory results were obtained. The primary objective of road sign
detection was also successfully completed and the signs were marked
on the generated trajectories.
